    <p>
        With all ingredients or only what you want, shaorma can be made at home, with ingredients you know where they come from.
        Home-made chicken Shaorma is a healthier alternative than every other you could buy from the streets.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>3-4 potatoes</li>
        <li>Fresh lettuce</li>
        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>2-3 pickles</li>
        <li>1 small cup of sour cream</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 spoons of ketchup</li>
        <li>4 medium flatabreads</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and slice the potatoes for frying, slice and grill the chicken breast and chop the vegetables.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, take each slice of chicken breast and shred it with your hands into long strips (you have more grain than with a knife), breaking the pieces along the grain.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, grind the garlic in the cream and mix, then add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Finely chop the cabbage, onions and cucumbers.</li>
        <li>After you've fried the potatoes, it's time to assemble the shaorma: heat the stick a little on the stove, on low heat, grease the stick with garlic sauce, then put a quarter of the ingredients in the following order: meat, potatoes, ketchup, followed by cabbage, onion and pickled cucumbers.</li>
        <li>Don't fill the flatbread too much, so that you can lift the bottom edge of it over the ingredients, and you can roll it easily. After you have tightened it well (be careful not to break the flatbread!), cover your hand with a glove and cover the bottom of the shaorma, then lift the bag so that you wrap it tightly around the flatbread, so that it does not come off in while you enjoy it.</li>
        <li>Proceed in the same way with the remaining 3 flatbreads and thus obtain 4 portions of homemade chicken shaorma.</li>
    </ol>
