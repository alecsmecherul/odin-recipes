        <li>1kg of flour</li>
        <li>50g fresh yeast or 14g dry</li>
        <li>350ml (400ml max) warm milk</li>
        <li>250g sugar</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>150ml oil or 100ml oil and 100g melted butter</li>
        <li>~25g of vanilla sugar</li>
        <li>2 lemon peels and 1 orange peel</li>
        <li>10-12g salt (measured!)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300g colored rahat (Turkish delight)</li>
        <li>150g nuts</li>
        <li>100g sugar</li>
        <li>50g cocoa</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Additional</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>50ml milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>All ingredients must be at room temperature. Less the milk and oil that we will heat. Sift the flour into a large bowl. First we prepare the mayo. Put 4-5 tablespoons of warm milk in a small bowl. Add a spoonful of sugar and crushed yeast over it. We mix until they are melted. Then add 2 tablespoons of flour and incorporate it. Cover the bowl with food foil and a kitchen towel and leave the mayo to ferment in a warm place for 10-15 minutes. You can also use dry yeast, around 25 g.</li>
        <li>Add the salt powder over the yolks and mix a little. We leave them aside, so the salt will accentuate the color of the yolks. We heat the milk until it is slightly hot. Then we add sugar and flavors on top of it. Mix very well until the sugar has melted. While mixing, the milk will cool down, just enough to be warm (30ºC). We try it with the back of the little finger. If it feels warm, it is only good to put on top of the flour. First, make a hole in the bowl with the flour and then add the milk with the dissolved sugar and the flavors. We also put the mayo, which has grown very well in the meantime, and the egg yolks. Mix with a fork in a circular way to incorporate the flour. Or we can directly insert clean hands and form the dough. You can also use a kneading robot, it will make your work easier.</li>
        <li>The resulting dough will be very sticky, so now we have to start gradually adding the warm oil while continuing to knead. Add a little oil, knead until incorporated and then add again. This process may take 10-12 minutes. It's time to knead the cake. If at the end you see that the dough is still sticking to your hands, add 2-3 tablespoons of oil and knead. Then we form it into a ball and place it in the bowl. We cover the dough with food foil and some kitchen towels to maintain the temperature inside. That way it will grow faster. If you have an oven with fermentation mode, you can put the dough inside, so it will rise in 40 minutes. Otherwise, it will be delayed by around an hour and a bit.</li>
        <li>While the dough is rising, prepare the filling. Beat the egg whites together with the powdered sugar and lemon juice. Then we add the sifted cocoa on top of them and incorporate it with a spatula. Add the ground walnut and incorporate it. Optionally, we can add a rum essence, it will give it a very good taste. I put the filling aside until we use it.

            We remove the leavened dough from the bowl onto the work table greased with a little oil. If necessary, we also grease our hands with oil. We fold the dough several times, so we will remove the air on one side and insert it on the other side. With this procedure, the cake will come out very fluffy. Then we divide the dough into 2 equal parts. We put one of them on the work table and put the other one back in the bowl and cover it with a towel. Divide the dough part on the table into 2 other parts.</li>
        <li>Grease the table with oil and stretch each part of the dough by hand into a rectangular sheet with the same length as the tray in which we will bake the muffins. The thickness of the sheet should be about one finger or 1 cm. Put a quarter of the filling on top and also raisins to taste. You can also put a few pieces of shit if you like. Then we start rolling the dough to close it. We seal it well at the bottom and at both ends. Put aside the first sheet and do the same with the second one. Then we braid the bun. We join the two strips obtained at one end, after which we twist it 3-4 times. We also seal it at the other end, after which we put it in a tray lined with baking paper. If you don't have baking paper, you can grease the tray with butter or lard. We do the same with the second cake. We leave them to ferment for another 30 minutes. During this time, preheat the oven to 170ºC with top and bottom heat.</li>
        <li>Then we grease the muffins with egg yolk, in which we also put a spoonful of milk. For the decoration I used sesame seeds, but you can also use poppy seeds if you like. And at the end, sprinkle a little powdered sugar on top of the cakes for a crispier crust. We put them in the oven for about 50-55 minutes or until they are brown. After 50 minutes you can try them with a toothpick. If you see that they have browned before time, you can cover them with aluminum foil. When they are ready, we take them out of the oven and leave them in the pan for about 10 minutes and then we can take them out on a grill to cool completely. Then they can be cut and enjoyed with pleasure. Good cooking my dears!</li>
